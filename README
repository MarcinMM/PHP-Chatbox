A simple self-refreshing chatbox in PHP, for those of us stuck in proxy-land. Can be hosted anywhere that can run PHP. 
Uses jQuery (included), but only for ease of .ajax and DOM addressing, and JSON file format. No DB needed.

Lacks authentication, spam prevention, etc. Heck, it doesn't even have multiple submit protection. Feel free to implement in your own time. ;)
